<t><b>Version control systems (VCS)</b> are essential tools that help track changes in files (usually source code) over time. They allow multiple people to collaborate on projects, keep a history of modifications, and revert to earlier versions when needed. This reading guide will walk you through the history of version control – from its early centralized beginnings to today’s distributed systems – and highlight modern trends shaping how we use version control. We’ll compare major tools (like CVS, Subversion, Git), explain centralized vs. distributed concepts, and discuss new practices (GitOps, CI/CD integration, cloud platforms, and AI tools). Real-world examples and case studies are included to illustrate practical applications.</t>
